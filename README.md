An intuitive Firefox extension to bookmark your favorite moments in YouTube videos with ease. Save timestamps, organize them, and revisit anytimeâ€”all within your browser.

## Features

- **Instant Bookmarking**: Press the big, full-width "+" button in the extension's GUI to capture the current video's share URL with the exact timestamp.
- **Organized Bookmark List**:
  - Displays the **video title**.
  - Shows the **timestamp duration** (e.g., `1:20`).
  - Notes **when the bookmark was created**.
- **Manage Your Bookmarks**:
  - **Remove** bookmarks with the "-" minus button.
  - **Archive** bookmarks for future reference.
- **Archive Access**: A dedicated button at the bottom lets you view your archived bookmarks.
